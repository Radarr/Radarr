    :wave: @{issue-author}, In order to help you further we'll need to see logs. 
    You'll need to enable trace logging and replicate the problem that you encountered. 
    Guidance on how to enable trace logging can be found in 
    our [troubleshooting guide](https://wiki.servarr.com/radarr/troubleshooting#logging-and-log-files).
