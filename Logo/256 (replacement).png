// I apologize - I'm not at all familiar with GitHub. I'd like to propose replacing the 256.png logo image with this one: https://i.imgur.com/WfcxC8g.png
// 
// The new image image has transparency, which will look better in Android notifications. See this issue for some more info: https://github.com/Radarr/Radarr/issues/2518
// 
// I couldn't figure out how to submit the new file. Please let me know if anything more is needed.
